                        <p>Family is the most important thing in everyone’s life. It is the anchor that holds and binds all together. Sharing happy times and supporting each other through the rough times is what makes a family so important. Today, lives move at a staggering speed and more often than not, people just don’t have enough time for each other. Barring the occasional movie and dinner outings, everyone is busy in their own lives. This is where family tour packages come as saviours. Especially in India, a family holiday package can be an outlet to have a great time together</p>
